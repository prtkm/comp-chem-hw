# Lipid bilayer
#

# Every atom from all molecules will be at least 4.5 Angstroms 
# away from each other at the final configuration.

tolerance 4.5 

# Coordinate file types will be in xyz format (keyword not required for
# pdb file format, but required for tinker, xyz or moldy).

filetype xyz

# The output xyz file

output bilayer.xyz

# There will be 2 sections below, 
#  1) bottom leaf of bilayer                 0 < z < 16
#  2) upper leaf of bilayer                 17 < z < 33

# First lipid layer: the polar head is oriented down to the water
# molecules. 18 lipids will be put inside a box of side 20 in the x and y
# directions and 16 in the z direction (16 is a little more than that
# length of the lipid). Atom 14 of the xyz file of this lipid,
# which is the Oxygen on the hydroxyl group, will be constrained to be
# below the the plane z = 2, and atom 1, which is the carbon
# on the hydrophobic end will be constrained to be over the plane
# z = 12. Therefore, all the lipids will be oriented, with their polar
# heads pointing to the water box below.

# Second lipid layer: the polar head points up to the water molecules. 
# The same thing as the input above, but defining a new lipid layer,
# with the oposite orientation of the lipid molecules in such a way that
# the polar head points to the water box that is over the lipid bilayer.
# We also include a 1 angstrom gap between the two leaves.
